# my_first_python_project
Here you can find my first Python project. It is a simple game (type rock paper scissors) that tries to unveil human movements and win the game
One of the objectives of the thread was providing the code in the less possible lines. I tried to optimized the code but lot of potential improvements have not
been considered. Anyway, it was my first project!
